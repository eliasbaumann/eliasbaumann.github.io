intro: |
  [Härting](https://haerting.de/), a German law firm focusing on intellectual property and information technology law, produces a weekly podcast hosted by Dr. Martin Schirmbacher, a leading expert in the field. Each episode features Dr. Schirmbacher and a colleague discussing current developments in IT and IP law, joined by guests who bring specialized knowledge to the conversation.

  I was invited to [Härting FM](https://haerting.de/wissen/?_insights_podcast_series=haertingfm) to share my perspective on patient data regulations in German and Swiss research, exploring both the importance of data protection and how these necessary safeguards can present challenges for medical research.
