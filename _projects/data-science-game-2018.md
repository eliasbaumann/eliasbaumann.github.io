intro: |
  Data Science Game was a yearly competition sponsored by [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/) and supported by Microsoft, Axa, BNP Paribas and Cdiscount and other companies heavily involved in data science.

  In 2018, the competition went into its fourth round, and focused on drop-off analysis for a e-commerce platform. Specifically, teams were tasked to best predict when a customer would leave during a search and purchase process.

      Our team developed an ensemble method using multiple (popular) machine learning algorithms in the typical kaggle style, but unfortunately, we did
      not score well enough to make it into top three. Yet, our team was most successful with their social media presence, such that we won 
      the engagement award.
