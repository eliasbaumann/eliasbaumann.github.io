intro: |
  In 2021, the [University of Osnabr√ºck](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/) hosted a Hackathon on using 
  deep learning and machine learning for climate and cryosphere forecasting.
  The Hackathon consisted of three days of hacking, and a final presentation.

      Our Team, Snow Clue, placed first with an innovative approach of using
      convolutional sequence-to-sequence LSTMs for short to intermediate
      snow cover forecasting and took the first place in that category.
      I developed the entire deep learning pipeline, including data preparation,
      validation and optimization. My team developed a web application to 
      visualize results and make them easily accessible.
